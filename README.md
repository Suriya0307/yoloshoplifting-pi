## 💡 Project Overview

This project builds a **shoplifting detection system** that uses **YOLOv8 pose estimation** to analyze human posture in CCTV footage and **XGBoost classification** to identify suspicious behavior.

It bridges **computer vision** and **machine learning** to assist store security by automatically flagging potential theft incidents.

> “**We didn’t just detect movement — we taught machines to understand human intent.**”

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Pose Detection** → YOLOv8 extracts key body landmarks from each frame.  
2. **Feature Extraction** → Joint positions are converted into numeric features.  
3. **Behavior Classification** → XGBoost model classifies actions as *Normal* or *Suspicious*.  
4. **Visualization** → Results are displayed live using OpenCV overlays.

## 🖼️ Features

✅ Real-time pose estimation using YOLOv8  
✅ Behavior classification with XGBoost  
✅ Works on webcam or video input  
✅ Live visualization with OpenCV  
✅ Supports dataset creation for model retraining
