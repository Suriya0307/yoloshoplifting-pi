## 💡 Project Overview

This project implements a **shoplifting detection system** that monitors surveillance video in real-time.  
Using **YOLOv8 Pose Estimation**, it captures human joint positions, and through **XGBoost classification**, it identifies abnormal or suspicious behavior.

It merges **computer vision** and **machine learning** to provide a cost-effective, scalable, and intelligent store security solution.

> “We didn’t just detect movement — we taught machines to understand human intent.”

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Pose Detection:**  
   YOLOv8 extracts skeletal keypoints (body joints) from live video frames.

2. **Feature Extraction:**  
   These keypoints are converted into feature vectors representing human posture and motion.

3. **Behavior Classification:**  
   An XGBoost model classifies the detected action as **Normal** or **Suspicious**.

4. **Real-Time Output:**  
   OpenCV displays live bounding boxes, labels, and confidence levels on the video feed.
